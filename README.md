A Simple Tennis Game

This is a simple tennis game application which has been implemented such that each set is one game. The player that wins a set is considered as a winner.

To test the program, you can directly import the project and run it in the eclipse itself. In the program, you will be able to test the tennis scoring and winning scenarios only with the help of test cases.
